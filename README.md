# Face_Recognition_Using_DeepLearning
<b>In this project we will develop Face Recognition using :</b><br>
- OpenCV
- Python
- Deep learning
<p>We will use deep metric learning concept for Face Recognition</p>
<b>Following are steps for creating Face Recognition project :</b>
<b>Step 1: Install required libraries</b><br>
1. Install dilb <br>
 - pip install dlib<br>
2. Install face_recognition package<br>
 - pip install face_recognition<br>
3. Install imutils <br>
 - pip install imutils<br>
<b>Step 2: Create directory structure as following:</b><br>

<b>Step 3: Train Model for Face Recognition </b><br>
<ul>
  <li>Create the 128-d embeddings for each face in the dataset</li>
  <li>Use these embeddings to recognize the faces of the characters in both images and video streams</li>
</ul>  
<p>We certainly could train a network from scratch or even fine-tune the weights of an existing model but that is more than likely overkill for many projects. Furthermore, you would need a lot of images to train the network from scratch.</p>
